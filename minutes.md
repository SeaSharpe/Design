### Meeting canceled due to midterms

## October 28, 2015
Rob and Steve Absent (We had trouble finding a room, they may not have got the memo that we found one)

### Review
- We had several miniature meetings in this design phase in which we discussed any questions people had, and looked over the prototype template Nicole created
- Looked over deliverables for:
  - prototype samples
- Rob had begun report designs, Nicole had reviewed and made suggestions
- Realized we were missing 2 deliverables: 1) security, 2) business logic and data validation

### During the Meeting
- John volunteered to take care of security
- Nicole volunteered to start busines logic and data validation and members agreed that we would complete it together next meeting
- Discussed whether or not to change the game id, because we currently have different ids for the same game on different platforms
  - We decided to leave as is and change the report that was showing the same id for a game across all platforms

### Moving forward
- determined that we are aiming to have all components complete by November 6th


**Next Meeting: November 4th**
### Meeting moved until class time November 6th
